## *How to properly start a server*

Before launching the server, ensure that a local MySQL Database is running.

We recommend using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/). Once installed, open XAMPP, and start both **Apache** and **MySQL**.

To initiate the server, open the game and choose **Run as Server**. Once the necessary information is provided, the server will run.

## *Technical infos*

The game has been built using pure Java SE 21 and MySQL.

### Custom Java Swing Interface:

- Our project features a bespoke Java Swing interface designed to maintain the classic console aesthetic.
- This unique design not only retains the charm of the traditional look but also incorporates modern features such as options selection, color schemes, and more.
